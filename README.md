# *Virtual Reality Space Game*
## *NASA Psyche Mission in conjunction with VCU*
## *Short Project Description*
The NASA Psyche Mission is an orbiter mission to the metal-rich asteroid, Psyche, in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The spacecraft, which launched in October 2023 and will arrive at the asteroid in mid-2029, will study the asteroid from orbit and will not land on the surface. Over the past few years, teams from the Psyche capstone program have produced many different styles of games designed to engage students and the public in learning about the Psyche mission. These games are appropriate for many different age levels - some are focused on learning while others are just for entertainment. In this project, your team will select one of the existing games and take it (or at least its content and game mechanics) to the next level - into virtual reality! You'll have the chance to test your experience at public or campus events throughout the year.
